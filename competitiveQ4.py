# Hulk is a good young dude from Kasna village. He goes to Haldiram to buy N types of sweets for celebrating Diwali with his friends. Initially he bought sweets in kilos S = [s1, s2, s3â€¦sN]. After paying bills he gets a call from his friends saying that he has to buy sweets in the following order. Every sweet Si has to be lesser or equal to next sweet Si+1. So he tells the Haldiram bhayya to make it in that way. Now bhayya can either add a kilo or remove a kilo of sweet from Si at a time. Now Hulk needs to tell Bhayya the minimum number of times T required to make the sweets in the specific order. For example S = [1, 2, 1, 4, 3] then T = 2. First we can add a kilo to 3rd sweet and subtract a kilo from 4th sweet to get [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]. If S = [1, 2, 2, 100] then T = 0.
